**Next ID:** AQ-028

**Threshold:** when 10+ findings are open, a full-codebase
Artisan review is required before continuing feature work.

### AQ-027 — Cycle handling in build_subtree undocumented

- **Date:** 2026-04-03
- **Category:** Type Safety
- **Commit context:** v0.30.0 tree command
- **Description:** `build_subtree` uses `seen` set to
  produce `Reference` nodes for revisited tasks. This
  also acts as a cycle guard, but cycles are already
  rejected by `add_dependency`. Behavior is correct but
  the cycle-guard aspect is undocumented.

### AQ-001 — Silent complexity fallback masks unscored tasks

- **Date:** 2026-04-03
- **Category:** Error Handling
- **Commit context:** v0.13.0 Gantt chart
- **Description:** `unwrap_or(1)` when complexity is
  `None` makes unscored tasks indistinguishable from
  complexity-1 tasks. Chart looks authoritative but may
  be meaningless if most tasks are unscored.
- **Impact:** Misleading planning chart.
- **Suggested fix:** Add `width_is_estimated: bool` to
  `GanttRow`, warn on stderr when defaults are used.
